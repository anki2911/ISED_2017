\section{Conclusion} \label{con}
\noindent
In this paper, we present the problem of open page policy in state-of-the-art DRAM controllers and the problem in 
using these DRAMs in real time systems. In real time systems, though the real time tasks are scheduled based on some priority
based scheduling algorithms at the processor, the tasks are not executed in the same order in the memory due to prioritization
of some other tasks at the DRAM controller. This becomes a bottleneck to guarantee 
completion of all real time tasks within their deadline. Finally, we proposed a scheduling algorithm at the DRAM which 
schedules the tasks based on a cost function evaluated on the basis of some local task parameters. We implemented an 
end-to-end simulator for the same and generated our results on the Malardalen WCET benchmark programs.
