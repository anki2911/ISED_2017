\section{Overview of the Problem}\label{mot}
\noindent
We are given a set of real time tasks, each with a deadline. the problem is to schedule the tasks on the DRAM such that the fewest number of tasks miss their deadlines.\\
$i^{th}$ task instance in a real time system, denoted by $\tau_{i}$ can be represented with the help of the following 
parameters -
\begin{center}
$\tau_{i}$ = ($A_{i}$, $E_{i}$, $D_{i}$, $P_{i}$),
\end{center}
where $A_{i}$ denotes the arrival time of $i^{th}$ task instance, $E_{i}$ denotes execution time of $i^{th}$ task instance,
$D_{i}$ denotes deadline of $i^{th}$ task instance, $P_{i}$ denotes the time interval after which the next task instance arrives.
\noindent
We present our problem with the help of a motivating example.
\subsection{Motivating Example}
\noindent
Let us consider a very simple DRAM with two banks, B0 and B1,
each bank having a set of four rows. The bank mapping of the two banks are as follows -
\begin{itemize}
 \item Bank B0 contains four sets of rows. Row 0 (addr 0 - addr 3), Row 1 (addr 4 - addr 7), Row 2 (addr 8 - addr 11) and 
 Row 3 (addr 12 - addr 15).
 \item Bank B1 contains four sets of rows. Row 0 (addr 16 - addr 19), Row 1 (addr 20 - addr 23), Row 2 (addr 24 - addr 27) 
 and Row 3 (addr 28 - addr 31).
\end{itemize}
We consider that our DRAM follows open page policy, i.e., memory requests which result in row hit will be allowed to access 
the DRAM. We consider two tasks T1 and T2 arriving at the same time instant and scheduled according to EDF at the processor.
Each task consists of some CPU and Memory instructions. In this example, we have denoted the CPU instructions with $<$C$>$ and 
the Memory instructions as $<$M addr$>$, which denotes a memory instruction at address ``addr''. We consider the task 
specifications given in Table \ref{tab1}. We consider each CPU instruction takes 100 cycles to execute,
each memory instruction takes 300 cycles to execute when there is a row miss and 200 cycles to execute when there is a row hit.
Since tasks are scheduled according to EDF, T2 will be allowed to access the CPU earlier. A detailed picture of the 
waiting queue at the processor, the processor, the memory buffer, the memory and the status of T1 and T2 at different
cycles is described in Table \ref{tab2}. It can be inferred from this example, that due to address mapping policy, all the 
memory requests are mapped to Bank B1. Again, due to the open row policy, some of T1's memory requests although arrived 
earlier, could not get access to memory. As a result, T1 cannot complete its execution within its deadline. 

\begin{table}[t]
\begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline
 \bf{Task}& \bf{Instructions}& \bf{Bank}& \bf{Deadline} \\ 
 \bf{ID}  &             & \bf{Mapping}&      \\ \hline
 T1 & C & & 1800 cycles \\
    & M 25 & Bank1-Row2 & \\
    & M 20 & Bank1-Row1 & \\
    & C & & \\
    & M 30 & Bank1-Row3 & \\
    & M 28 & Bank1-Row3 & \\ \hline
 T2 & C & & 1500 cycles \\
    & M 30 & Bank1-Row3 & \\
    & M 29 & Bank1-Row3 & \\
    & C & & \\
    & M 24 & Bank1-Row2 & \\ \hline
 \end{tabular}
 \end{center}
 \caption{Task Specifications}
\label{tab1}
\end{table}

\noindent
If T1's memory request is allowed to execute in Bank B0, then T1 can easily complete its execution within its deadline.
But executing a memory request in some other memory bank incurs a lot of overheads. We propose a novel method of bank aware 
memory partitioning based on a cost function calculated locally so that the tasks can complete execution within deadline. We discuss our proposal in the following.

\subsection{Detailed Methodology}
\noindent
We have implemented a two level scheduler, one at the processor and the other at the memory controller. We have applied EDF to 
schedule tasks at the processor, i.e., tasks whose deadline is earliest is placed at the front of the priority queue and are 
allowed to execute first. But as the memory requests arrive at the DRAM controller, they are not executed in the order 
they are scheduled. Open page policy prioritizes those memory requests which result in row buffer hit of tasks. We propose 
to keep a set of extra memory banks which will not participate in address mapping. We formulate a cost function based on some
known task parameters and we schedule tasks based on the cost function. Cost function, $C_{ij}$, is the cost to execute 
$i^{th}$ instruction of $j^{th}$ task. 
\newline
We define another variable, $C_{ijk}$, which is the time to execute $i^{th}$ instruction of $j^{th}$ task in $k^{th}$ bank 
and is given by-
\begin{center}
$C_{ijk}$ = $D_{j}$ - ($t_{ik}$ + $e_{iw}$ + $e_{ik}$ + $e_{rem}$)
\end{center}
where $D_{j}$ : the deadline of $j^{th}$ task,
\newline
$t_{ik}$ : the time to copy the $i^{th}$ instruction in $k^{th}$ bank,
\newline
$e_{iw}$ : the maximum waiting time of $i^{th}$ task in the memory buffer due to presence of other tasks infront of the $i^{th}$ instruction in the memory buffer,
\newline
$e_{ik}$ : the execution time of $i^{th}$ instruction in $k^{th}$ bank if there is a row miss/hit,
\newline
$e_{rem}$ : the worst case execution time required by the remaining instructions of $j^{th}$ task.
\newline
Similarly, $C_{ijk'}$ is defined as the time to execute $i^{th}$ instruction of $j^{th}$ task in its own bank (where it is 
actually mapped), say k'.
\begin{center}
$Cost_{ij}$ = $C_{ijk}$ - $C_{ijk'}$
\end{center}
If $Cost_{ij}$ is greater than 0, we allow the task to execute in its own bank, otherwise we schedule it to execute in any one 
of the reserved set of banks. 
\newline
Algorithm \ref{alg1} explains our proposed method.
